# Structured-Problem-Solving_Capstone_Funnel-Analysis
I developed actionable insights to improve conversion rates by systematically analyzing the Funnel. By examining each stage of the customer journey—listing, menu, cart, payment, and order sessions—I identified critical drop-off points and bottlenecks impacting user engagement. Using these findings, I formulated targeted strategies to address specific challenges, ensuring data-driven enhancements to the user experience.
The project involved leveraging traffic data from multiple channels, assessing the impact of promotional activities, and tracking day-over-day performance metrics. This approach not only optimized conversion rates but also streamlined the customer journey, resulting in a more engaging and efficient platform. The insights derived laid the groundwork for sustained improvement in user acquisition, retention, and satisfaction on platform.
